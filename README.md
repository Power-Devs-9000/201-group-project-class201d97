## Authors: Darshon, Logan, Ryan E, and Reece

## Project Description
Our project is a quiz style matching game.  We will present the user with a question and 5 possible answers and allow the user 3 guesses to get the correct answer.  We will build a database of questions that will help benefit people learning to code from the knowledge we have gained from our classes. We will create a "game board" that will present the question and answers and then reset the board with a new question and answer after 3 failed attempts or the correct answer is chosen.  We will be utilzing 3 HMTL files to hold our index(main page), about us, and score page.  We will have unique styles sheets for each and two of the html pages will require script tags for functionality.
