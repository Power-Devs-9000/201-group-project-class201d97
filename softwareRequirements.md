Minimum Length: 3-5 sentences

What is the vision of this product?
Our vision is to create a study tool for software development students. 

What pain point does this project solve?
One of the hardest parts of coding boot camps is retaining all of the information. Studying, especially when it's in the form of an interactive game, is a great way to help individuals form the physiological pathways in the brain to retain information.

Why should we care about your product?
This will be a free to access project that any up and coming software developer may utilize to help hone their skills with various categories of the field. Our project promotes self-improvement, and by making it into a fun game, may inspire future devs to actively study.

## Scope In/Out

Our web app will present users with a software development question, then provide multiple possible answers of which the user has three attempts at selecting the appropriate answer.

Should the user guess the correct answer, the board will wipe and then present the next question. Should the user guess incorrectly and run out of attempts, the app will provide the correct answer, then wipe and reset.

The user's score will be locally stored and displayed on a scoreboard page, where they can track their attempts and scores.


* OUT - What will your product not do.

Although we can make the webpage responsive so that it adjusts with device screen size so that it can be played on various devices, our application will be limited to being exclusively a web browser game rather than an IOS or Android app.
